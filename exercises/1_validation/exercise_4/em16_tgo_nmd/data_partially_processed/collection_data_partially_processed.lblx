			NOMAD
			=====
			
			NOMAD is is a 3-channel spectrometer designed to perform high-sensitivity orbital identification of atmospheric components, 
			concentration and temperature, their sources, loss, and cycles. It measures the sunlight reflected from the surface and 
			atmosphere of Mars, and it analyses its wavelength spectrum to identify the components of the Martian atmosphere 
			that may suggest a biological source.
			
			This spectrometer consists of three channels: solar occultation (SO), limb nadir and occultation (LNO), and ultraviolet 
			and visible spectrometer (UVIS). The first two channels work in the infrared (2.2 to 4.3 μm); the third 
			channel (UVIS) works in the UV-visible range (0.2 to 0.65 μm), which is able to measure ozone, sulphuric acid, and perform 
			aerosol studies. Measurements are carried out during solar occultation, i.e. the instrument points toward the sunset 
			as the orbiter moves toward or away the dark side of Mars. It also measures in nadir mode, i.e. looking directly at the 
			sunlight reflected from the surface and atmosphere of Mars.
			
			The Principal Investigator is Ann Carine Vandaele, from the Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy.
			
			The Partially_Processed_Data Collection
			=======================================
			
			The Partially Processed data collection contains science and housekeeping data from the instrument which is processed to 
			an intermediate stage between raw and calibated. Note calibrated data is defined as having all instrument related artifacts 
			removed. For NOMAD the partially processed data represents a relatively early stage of processing with all HK data
			converted to physical values. All NOMAD data types except SIMBAD (the on-board computer) have partially processed versions
			and for the science data only those parts of the data files relating to HK type data are converted, the actual science data
			itself remains in instrument units.
			
			The data are released publicly on a daily basis with a six month lag from the data being obtained. 
			
			(Note LNO data is not yet publically available so can not be downloaded from any time period)
			
			Physically the collection is organised by science phase, then orbit range in groups of 100 orbits, then orbit. Different 
			data types e.g. HK plus science from different channels may be mixed in this time related directory.
			
			A description of the partially processed data products can be found in the NOMAD Experiment to Archive ICD (EAICD). This 
			can be found under documents in the user interface or via the Document Collection in the PSA ftp disctribution. A quick 
			start guide can also be found at: https://issues.cosmos.esa.int/socciwiki/display/PSAPUB1/NOMAD+Quick+Start+Guide
